      <h2>What is the significance of the Egyptian scarabs</h2><p><b>Old Kingdom 2649–3050 BC to Ptolemaic Period AD 395</b></p>
What about the inscriptions carved into the bottoms of the scarabs? Throughout the 3000 or so years that the Egyptians held the scarab beetle in esteem how did the significance change throughout the different kingdoms? </br>
</br>
For the Egyptians, in all of that time, the scarab symbol was as prevalent to them as the cross is today for Westerners. This reverence of symbols wasn't only limited to Egyptians. Scaraboid figures, along with other interesting amulets and figures have been found throughout the ancient world spanning the Mediterranean, Middle East and Near Asia.

     <!--Dung Beetle Paragraph-->
     <div class="box3"><h2 id="Egyptian Symbology">Egyptian Symbology</h2>Why did the Egyptians choose to revere the Scarab beetle? The Scarab beetle, a.k.a. the Dung beetle collects animal droppings to eat and lay its eggs into. The beetle rolls the dung until it becomes a perfect sphere. Dung beetles also bury themselves into the sand and then days later reemerge.</br></br>  To a human observer, it may appear that the Dung beetles emerge from the sand as fully mature beetles to which then either fly to the sky or roll balls of mud and dung which in some ways resemble the sphere shape of the sun.</br></br> 
The ancient Egyptians watched the way that the beetle worked all day pushing the enormous ball across the sand, only to dig into the sand and reemerge having multiplied and fly away. This observance may have reminded them of their own sun god Re.

Although scarabs became extremely popular by the first intermediate period (2160–2055 BC) they made their first appearances very early on during the 6th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom period (2649-2150 BC). These early appearances were thought to be for ornamental purposes. </br></br> Scarabs were indeed beautiful to look at. The Egyptians made scarabs into rings, bracelets and necklaces. Their beauty was so admired that scarab use for jewelry spread throughout the Mediterranean to cultures beyond Egypt, including the Phoenicians, Greeks and Canaanites.

These amulets were used to obtain good luck and to help assure eternal life in paradise aided by the Sun God Re or the Creator of the Universe, Utum. </br></br>Just like how there is a lucrative market for crystals in today for the way they purportedly capture energy and transmit it to the bearer or wearer, the ancient Egyptians also wanted to benefit from a piece of geology, although the mechanisms would have worked differently. </br></br> The owners name inscribed on the back of a scarab made it even more powerful for good luck and delivery to the afterlife. Royalty made sure to have these buried with their body.

The “heart scarab” was placed on top of the heart of a mummified remains of wealthy Egyptians so the soul of the person who had died will be ready for devine tests for entrance into the after life. Egyptian lore states that a newly deceased soul will have their heart weighed against a feather by a divinity, and with the heart scarab he or she will have the magic to pass the test.</br></br>
The inscription on the bottom of the heart scarab would guide the soul through the afterlife to eternal life. Often the inscriptions were hieroglyphics of a chapter from “The Book of the Dead”.

With time, the ancients realized a new innovation: impressions in clay could be used for record keeping and tamper proofing. The scarab was a very convenient shape for signing a document with a stamp or for imprinting on soft clay. Egypt, along with other ancient societies were very organized and highly bureaucratic. Accounting for goods and services was integral to how their kingdoms created their wealth. Papyrus documents were used, chests were sealed, vases with cork stoppers marked, and rooms holding grains were sealed shut. They also used the carved bottoms of the scarabs as stamping their personal signatures.
